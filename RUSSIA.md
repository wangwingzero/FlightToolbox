In local routine and special reports the runway visual range is reported when visibility is 2000m or less.

Reporting of braking action:

| Code | Measured FC    | (Russian FC)   | Braking Action |
| ---- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| 5    | 0.40 and above | 0.42 and above | Good           |
| 4    | 0.39 - 0.36    | 0.41 - 0.40    | Good to Medium |

Meteorological reports (METAR) at most of the aerodromes of the Russian Federation currently include normative friction coefficient, but there are some exceptions, for example, Sheremetyevo aerodrome METAR report contains information on measured friction coefficient.
