# FLIGHT CREW OPERATING MANUAL

# GENERAL

Ident.: PRO-NOR-SOP-05-00011095.0001001 / 05 MAY 22

Applicable to: ALL

The exterior walkaround ensures that the general condition of the aircraft is satisfactory and that the visible aircraft components and equipment are safe for the flight:

- There is no impact damage to the structure  
- There is no evident fuel, oil, or hydraulic leak  
- All ground access doors are closed  
- All covers are removed (e.g. pitot covers, AOA covers, etc.).

The flight crew must perform a complete walkaround before each flight.

The parking brake must be set to ON during the exterior walkaround, in order to enable the flight crew to check brake wear indicators.

WARNING

If any landing gear door is open, do not apply hydraulic power until clearance is obtained from ground personnel.
