### 1. FLIGHT LIMITATIONS

#### 1.1. LOAD FACTORS

Aircraft are designed to be resistant to several flight loads that mainly come from engines, wind gusts and maneuver cases. During the flight, load factors (n₂), e.g. maneuver and turbulence, may appear and increase loads on the aircraft. The load factors have an impact on the maximum weights and maximum speeds.

> “(a) Strength requirements are specified in terms of limit loads (the maximum loads to be expected in service) and ultimate loads (limit loads multiplied by prescribed factors of safety). Unless otherwise provided, prescribed loads are limit loads."

**CS/FAR 25.321 Flight Loads**

> "(a) Flight Load Factors represent the ratio of the aerodynamic force component (acting normal to the assumed longitudinal axis of the airplane) to the weight of the airplane. A positive load factor is one in which the aerodynamic force acts upward with respect to the airplane.”

```
      Lift
n_z = ------
     Weight
```

Except when the lift force is equal to the weight (W) and n₂=1 (for example, in straight and level flight), the aircraft apparent weight (Wₐ) is different from its actual weight (mg):

```
Wₐ = n_z * m * g = Lift
```

In some cases, the load factor is more than 1 (bank turn, recovery, turbulence). In other cases, it may be less than 1 (clear air turbulence). The aircraft structure is designed to be resistant to load factors, as defined by the regulations. As a result, load factor limits are defined, so that an aircraft can operate within these limits without suffering permanent distortion of its structure. The extreme loads that can cause rupture, are usually 1.5 times the load factor limit.

The altitude tape on the right shows an altitude of 32,000 feet.]

#### 1.2.2. Maximum Brake Energy Speed: Vᴍʙᴇ

Brakes require a minimum stopover time to cool and recover full efficiency after each use.

When the takeoff is rejected, brakes and the aerodynamic drag must absorb and eliminate the aircraft's kinetic energy. When rejected at V1, this energy corresponds to:

```
(1/2 * Weight * V1²)
```

**CS 25.109 Subpart B / FAR 25.109 Subpart B**

> “(i) A flight test demonstration of the maximum brake kinetic energy accelerate-stop distance must be conducted with no more than 10% of the allowable brake wear range remaining on each of the aeroplane wheel brakes.”

Brakes have a maximum energy absorbent capacity, known as the maximum brake energy. For certification purposes, this capacity must be demonstrated with worn brakes (only post-amendment FAR 25-42). As a result, the speed at which a full stop can be achieved, for a specific takeoff weight, is limited to a maximum value (Vᴍʙᴇ).

> In the determination of Vᴍᴄɢ, assuming that the path of the aeroplane accelerating with all engines operating is along the centreline of the runway, its path from the point at which the critical engine is made inoperative to the point at which recovery to a direction parallel to the centreline is completed, may not deviate more than 30 ft laterally from the centreline at any point.”

#### 1.3.4. Minimum Unstick Speed: Vᴍᴜ

**CS 25.107 Subpart B / FAR 25.107 Subpart B**

> “(d) Vᴍᴜ is the calibrated airspeed at and above which the aeroplane can safely lift off the ground, and continue the take-off...”

Vᴍᴜ is the max between 2 speeds:

* The Vʟᴏꜰ with the maximum pitch angle ("*...safely lift off the ground*").
* The minimum speed ensuring a safe fly away from ground effects ("*...and continue the take-off*").

During the flight test demonstration, at a low speed (80-100 kt), the pilot pulls the control stick to the limit of the aerodynamic capacity of the control surfaces. The aircraft achieves a slow rotation to an angle-of-attack at which the maximum lift coefficient is reached. For aircraft with geometric limitations, the aircraft achieves a slow rotation until the tail touches/comes into contact with the runway (the tail is protected by a device).

After, the pitch is maintained until liftoff.

[Image: Combination of a chart and a photograph.
Chart: A graph of Lift off speed (Vʟᴏꜰ) vs. Angle of attack. It shows Vᴍᴜ being the Vʟᴏꜰ at the maximum angle of attack. A box lists "Max angle limit: Thrust ≤ Drag, Geometry Limit".
Photograph: Illustration A-5: VMU Demonstration (Geometrically-limited Aircraft). An A320 is shown in a high pitch attitude at takeoff, with a starburst graphic at the tail indicating contact with the runway (tail strike).]

In the case of One Engine Inoperative (OEI), the Vᴍᴜ (ɴ-₁) must ensure safe lateral control in order that the wing does not come into contact with the ground.

# AIRBUS

[Image: Illustration A-6: VMU Risk of Wing in Contact with the Ground. A diagram of an A320 with one engine out (indicated by a starburst) and a low wing, showing the risk of the wingtip contacting the ground during takeoff.]

Two Minimum Unstick Speeds (Vᴍᴜ) must be determined:

* With all engines operatives: Vᴍᴜ (ɴ)
* With one engine inoperative: Vᴍᴜ (ɴ-₁)

*Note: Vᴍᴜ (ɴ) is validated by flight test, Vᴍᴜ (ɴ-₁) is simulated by using a total thrust on both engines equivalent to OEI thrust.*

Thrust generates some lift (see the result of the thrust on the vertical axis on illustration A-7).
With all engines operating, the lift generated by the thrust is greater than the lift with OEI.
This means that the lift generated by the wings must be higher, in the case of one engine failure. This increased lift can only be reached through a speed increase. This means that, usually, Vᴍᴜ (ɴ) will be below Vᴍᴜ (ɴ-₁).

[Image: Illustration A-7: Engine Failure Effect on VMU. A diagram showing an aircraft in flight. It illustrates that Lift(N) ≥ Lift(N-1), which implies Vᴍᴜ (ɴ-₁) ≥ Vᴍᴜ (ɴ). It also shows that Thrust(N) is greater than Thrust(N-1).]

#### 1.3.5. Stall Speed

The stall speed definition changed since the A320 certification.

The stall speed can be explained as follows: when the angle-of-attack increases, the following events happen:

* Increase of the airflow speed over the wing (V in illustration A-8), and decrease of the airflow speed below the wing
* Decrease of the pressure over the wing
* Increase of the lift coefficient (Cʟ) and drag coefficient (Cᴅ).

# AIRBUS

[Image: Illustration A-8: Low Angle of Attack - No Airflow Separation. A diagram of a wing cross-section (airfoil) at a low angle of attack, showing smooth airflow over the top and bottom surfaces, generating lift (Cʟ) and drag (Cᴅ).]

The lift coefficient increases with the angle-of-attack. In level flight, the increase of the lift coefficient results in a decrease of the aircraft speed. The lift must balance the aircraft weight, that can be considered as constant at a specific time.

```
Angle of attack ↗   ⇒   Cʟ ↗
Weight = ½ * ρ * S * (TAS)² * Cʟ = constant
```

```
ρ = constant   S = constant   Lift = constant
Cʟ ↗   ⇒   TAS ↘
```

The speed cannot decrease beyond a minimum value. Above a certain angle-of-attack, the airflow starts to separate from the wing (Illustration A-9).

[Image: Illustration A-9: High Angle of Attack - Airflow Separation. A diagram of an airfoil at a high angle of attack. The airflow over the top surface becomes turbulent and separates from the wing, indicating a stall condition.]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# AIRBUS

Illustration A-10 demonstrates that the lift coefficient increases up to a maximum lift coefficient (Cʟᴍᴀx), and suddenly decreases, when the angle-of-attack is increased above a specific value. This is a stall.

[Image: Illustration A-10: Cʟ versus Angle of Attack. A graph plotting Lift Coefficient (Cʟ) on the y-axis against Angle of Attack / Calibrated Airspeed (CAS) on the x-axis. The curve rises to a peak (Cʟ ᴍᴀx) at Vs1g (where load factor n=1g), and then drops off into the stall area (where n < 1g) at Vs.]

There are two types of stall speed:

* **Vs1g** corresponds to the maximum lift coefficient (i.e. just before the lift starts to decrease). At this moment, the load factor is still equal to one.
* **Vs** corresponds to the conventional aerodynamic stall (i.e. when the lift suddenly collapses). At this moment, the load factor is always less than one.

> n_zw = Load factor normal to the flight path at Vᴄʟᴍᴀx
>
> (b) Vᴄʟᴍᴀx is determined with:
>
> * Engines idling, or if that resultant thrust causes an appreciable decrease in stall speed, not more than zero thrust at the stall speed;
> * The aeroplane, in other respects (such as flaps, landing gear and ice accretions) in the condition existing in the test or performance standard in which Vꜱʀ is being used;
