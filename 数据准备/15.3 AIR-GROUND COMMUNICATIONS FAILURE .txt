15.3 AIR-GROUND COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE 
Note 1.— Procedures to be applied in relation to an aircraft experiencing air-ground communication failure when 
providing ATS surveillance services are contained in Chapter 8, Section 8.8.3. 
 Note 2.— An aircraft equipped with an SSR transponder is expected to operate the transponder on Mode A Code 7600 
to indicate that it has experienced air-ground communication failure. An aircraft equipped with other surveillance system 
transmitters, including ADS-B and ADS-C, might indicate the loss of air-ground communication by all of the available 
means. 
 Note 3.— Some aircraft equipped with first generation ADS-B avionics have the capability to transmit a general 
emergency alert only, regardless of the code selected by the pilot. 
 Note 4.— See also Chapter 6, 6.3.2.5, concerning departure clearances containing no geographical or time limit for 
a cleared level below the flight planned level and procedures to be applied in relation to an aircraft experiencing 
air-ground communication failure under such circumstances.
Note 5. — See also Chapter 5, 5.4.2.6.3.2, for additional requirements applying to communication failure during the 
application of the 50 NM longitudinal RNAV/RNP 10 separation minimum. 
 15.3.1 Action by air traffic control units when unable to maintain two-way communication with an aircraft operating 
in a control area or control zone shall be as outlined in the paragraphs which follow. 
 15.3.2 As soon as it is known that two-way communication has failed, action shall be taken to ascertain whether the 
aircraft is able to receive transmissions from the air traffic control unit by requesting it to execute a specified manoeuvre 
which can be observed by an ATS surveillance system or to transmit, if possible, a specified signal in order to indicate 
acknowledgement. 
Note.— Some aircraft equipped with first generation ADS-B avionics do not have the capability of squawking 
IDENT while the emergency and/or urgency mode is selected. 
 15.3.3 If the aircraft fails to indicate that it is able to receive and acknowledge transmissions, separation shall be 
maintained between the aircraft having the communication failure and other aircraft, based on the assumption that the 
aircraft will: 
 a) if in visual meteorological conditions: 
 1) continue to fly in visual meteorological conditions; 
 2) land at the nearest suitable aerodrome; and 
 3) report its arrival by the most expeditious means to the appropriate air traffic control unit; or 
 b) if in instrument meteorological conditions or when conditions are such that it does not appear likely that the pilot 
will complete the flight in accordance with a): 
 1) unless otherwise prescribed on the basis of a regional air navigation agreement, in airspace where 
procedural separation is being applied, maintain the last assigned speed and level, or minimum flight 
altitude if higher, for a period of 20 minutes following the aircraft’s failure to report its position over a 
compulsory reporting point and thereafter adjust level and speed in accordance with the filed flight plan; or 
 2) in airspace where an ATS surveillance system is used in the provision of air traffic control, maintain the last 
assigned speed and level, or minimum flight altitude if higher, for a period of 7 minutes following: 
 i) the time the last assigned level or minimum flight altitude is reached; or 
 ii) the time the transponder is set to Code 7600 or the ADS-B transmitter is set to indicate the loss of 
air-ground communications; or 
 iii) the aircraft’s failure to report its position over a compulsory reporting point; 
 whichever is later and thereafter adjust level and speed in accordance with the filed flight plan; 
 3) when being vectored or having been directed by ATC to proceed offset using RNAV without a specified 
limit, proceed in the most direct manner possible to rejoin the current flight plan route no later than the next 
significant point, taking into consideration the applicable minimum flight altitude; 
 4) proceed according to the current flight plan route to the appropriate designated navigation aid or fix serving 
the destination aerodrome and, when required to ensure compliance with 5), hold over this aid or fix until 
commencement of descent;
5) commence descent from the navigation aid or fix specified in 4) at, or as close as possible to, the expected 
approach time last received and acknowledged; or, if no expected approach time has been received and 
acknowledged, at, or as close as possible to, the estimated time of arrival resulting from the current flight plan; 
 6) complete a normal instrument approach procedure as specified for the designated navigation aid or fix; and 
 7) land, if possible, within 30 minutes after the estimated time of arrival specified in 5) or the last acknowledged 
expected approach time, whichever is later. 
Note 1.— Provisions related to minimum levels are contained in Annex 2, 5.1.2. 
Note 2.— As evidenced by the meteorological conditions prescribed therein, 15.3.3 a) relates to all controlled flights, 
whereas 15.3.3 b) relates only to IFR flights. 
Note 3.— See also 8.6.5.1 b) concerning the requirement for the flight crew to be informed of what a vector is to 
accomplish and the limit of the vector. 
 15.3.4 Action taken to ensure suitable separation shall cease to be based on the assumption stated in 15.3.3 when: 
 a) it is determined that the aircraft is following a procedure differing from that in 15.3.3; or 
 b) through the use of electronic or other aids, air traffic control units determine that action differing from that 
required by 15.3.3 may be taken without impairing safety; or 
 c) positive information is received that the aircraft has landed. 
 15.3.5 As soon as it is known that two-way communication has failed, appropriate information describing the action 
taken by the air traffic control unit, or instructions justified by any emergency situation, shall be transmitted blind for the
attention of the aircraft concerned, on the frequencies available on which the aircraft is believed to be listening, including the 
voice frequencies of available radio navigation or approach aids. Information shall also be given concerning: 
 a) meteorological conditions favourable to a cloud-breaking procedure in areas where congested traffic may be 
avoided; and 
 b) meteorological conditions at suitable aerodromes. 
 15.3.6 Pertinent information shall be given to other aircraft in the vicinity of the presumed position of the aircraft 
experiencing the failure. 
 15.3.7 As soon as it is known that an aircraft which is operating in its area of responsibility is experiencing an apparent
radiocommunication failure, an air traffic services unit shall forward information concerning the radiocommunication failure to
all air traffic services units concerned along the route of flight. The ACC in whose area the destination aerodrome is located 
shall take steps to obtain information on the alternate aerodrome(s) and other relevant information specified in the filed flight 
plan, if such information is not available. 
 15.3.8 If circumstances indicate that a controlled flight experiencing a communication failure might proceed to 
(one of) the alternate aerodrome(s) specified in the filed flight plan, the air traffic control unit(s) serving the alternate 
aerodrome(s) and any other air traffic control units that might be affected by a possible diversion shall be informed of the 
circumstances of the failure and requested to attempt to establish communication with the aircraft at a time when the 
aircraft could possibly be within communication range. This shall apply particularly when, by agreement with the 
operator or a designated representative, a clearance has been transmitted blind to the aircraft concerned to proceed to an 
alternate aerodrome, or when meteorological conditions at the aerodrome of intended landing are such that a diversion to 
an alternate is considered likely.
15.3.9 When an air traffic control unit receives information that an aircraft, after experiencing a communication 
failure has re-established communication or has landed, that unit shall inform the air traffic services unit in whose area the 
aircraft was operating at the time the failure occurred, and other air traffic services units concerned along the route of 
flight, giving necessary information for the continuation of control if the aircraft is continuing in flight. 
 15.3.10 If the aircraft has not reported within thirty minutes after: 
 a) the estimated time of arrival furnished by the pilot; 
 b) the estimated time of arrival calculated by the ACC; or 
 c) the last acknowledged expected approach time, 
whichever is latest, pertinent information concerning the aircraft shall be forwarded to aircraft operators, or their 
designated representatives, and pilots-in-command of any aircraft concerned and normal control resumed if they so desire. 
It is the responsibility of the aircraft operators, or their designated representatives, and pilots-in-command of aircraft to 
determine whether they will resume normal operations or take other action.
