# GLOBAL REPORTING FORMAT FOR RUNWAY SURFACE CONDITIONS

NOTE: The ICAO implementation date is  $4^{th}$  November 21, however EASA and Canada applicability date is  $12^{th}$  August 21 and Iceland will implement it on  $1^{st}$  of October 21.

# GENERAL

New ICAO procedures for assessing and reporting runway surface conditions, commonly known as the Global Reporting Format (GRF), will be implemented. These procedures aim at harmonising internationally the methodology for assessing runway conditions, the reporting channels as well as the operational use for determining the required take-off and landing distances. The assessment and reporting of the condition of the movement areas and the associated installations are generally required to provide pilots with the necessary information for the safe and efficient operation of their aircraft. In future, the current runway conditions will, as required, be disseminated as a Runway Condition Report (RCR) via ATIS and radiotelephony as well as by means of SNOWTAM, if applicable. The new procedures are relevant to aerodrome operators, air traffic services and aircraft operators.

# DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURES

The GRF methodology implies the following:

- New terms and definitions: runway condition assessment matrix (RCAM), runway condition code (RWYCC), runway condition report (RCR).  
- For the RCR, the following elements will be transmitted in the GRF:

- runway condition code (RWYCC),  
- type of runway contamination,  
depth, and coverage

for each third of the runway, in the order from the threshold having the lower runway designation number.

- A new definition of SNOWTAM, which now also includes hazards due to (standing  $>3\mathrm{mm}$ ) water on the movement areas. This means that it may be necessary to publish a SNOWTAM message not only in the winter season. There will be a new SNOWTAM form and a new SNOWTAM message.  
- Determination of the runway condition by means of the RWYCC, which is derived from the RCAM, including the downgrading and upgrading criteria.  
- The maximum validity of a SNOWTAM was changed to 8 hours. After these 8 hours, a new SNOWTAM shall be issued until a message describing the surface condition as WET or DRY can be issued.

# Description of the procedural steps

a. The aerodrome operator shall assess the runway condition for each third of the runway and create an RCR. This report contains the RWYCC and further information characterising the

# GLOBAL REPORTING FORMAT FOR RUNWAY SURFACE CONDITIONS

runway condition (depth, type and coverage of contamination). The RWYCC is derived from the RCAM.

b. The RCR will be transmitted to the relevant local air traffic service (ATS) provider. ATS shall disseminate the information via ATIS, D-ATIS or radiotelephony, as appropriate. SNOWTAM will be disseminated on the basis of this information and in accordance with ICAO regulations.  
c. Aircraft operators will use the information received for aircraft performance calculations and to determine the required take-off and landing distances. Whenever the runway condition encountered is not as good as currently reported, the pilot shall inform ATS by transmitting an air-report (AIREP).  
d. ATS shall forward AIREPs received to the aerodrome operator who will then reassess the runway condition and initiate a downgrade of the RWYCC, if necessary.

NOTE: States that follow EASA Regulations additionally use SPECIALLY PREPARED WINTER RUNWAY for runway condition code 4 and the descriptor WET for runway condition code 3 is replaced by SLIPPERY WET.

# SNOWTAM

# Validity

The maximum validity period of SNOWTAM is reduced from 24 hours to 8 hours. If a SNOWTAM has not been replaced within this period, it will be invalidated automatically.

# Format

SNOWTAM are issued in accordance with the new SNOWTAM format, as shown below.

Inclusion of the different Items is either mandatory (M), conditional (C) or optional (O) as indicated.

When reporting on more than one runway, the Items B to H are repeated for each runway.

NOTE: The letters used to indicate the SNOWTAM Items are only used for reference purposes and will not be included in the SNOWTAM messages.

# Content

Item A

The 4-letter ICAO location indicator of the aerodrome.

Item B

Date and time of the assessment (8-figure date/time group giving time of observation as month, day, hours and minutes in UTC).

Item C

The lower runway designator number.

Item D

RWYCC. One digit (from 0 to 6) is inserted for each runway third, separated by oblique strokes.

Item E

Extent of runway contamination in percent for each runway third, separated by oblique strokes.

NOTE 1: This information is only provided when the RWYCC for each runway third (Item D) has been reported other than 6 and there is a condition description for each runway third (Item G) that has been reported other than "DRY".

NOTE 2: When the conditions are not reported, this is indicated by the insertion of "NR" for the relevant runway third.

Item F

Depth of loose contaminant in millimetres for each runway third, separated by oblique strokes.

NOTE 1: This information is only provided for the following contamination types: standing water, slush, wet or dry snow.

NOTE 2: mm (4mm for standing water) is the reported value if the assessed value is 3mm (4mm for standing water) or less. Otherwise, the assessed value will be reported.

NOTE 3: When the conditions are not reported, this is indicated by the insertion of "NR" for the relevant runway third.
