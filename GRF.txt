# GLOBAL REPORTING FORMAT (GRF) FOR RUNWAY SURFACE CONDITIONS

**NOTE:** The ICAO implementation date is 4th November 21, however EASA and Canada applicability date is 12th August 21 and Iceland will implement it on 1st of October 21.

## GENERAL

New ICAO procedures for assessing and reporting runway surface conditions, commonly known as the Global Reporting Format (GRF), will be implemented. These procedures aim at harmonising internationally the methodology for assessing runway conditions, the reporting channels as well as the operational use for determining the required take-off and landing distances. The assessment and reporting of the condition of the movement areas and the associated installations are generally required to provide pilots with the necessary information for the safe and efficient operation of their aircraft. In future, the current runway conditions will, as required, be disseminated as a Runway Condition Report (RCR) via ATIS and radiotelephony as well as by means of SNOWTAM, if applicable. The new procedures are relevant to aerodrome operators, air traffic services and aircraft operators.

## DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURES

The GRF methodology implies the following:

  * New terms and definitions: runway condition assessment matrix (RCAM), runway condition code (RWYCC), runway condition report (RCR).
  * For the RCR, the following elements will be transmitted in the GRF:
      * runway condition code (RWYCC),
      * type of runway contamination,
      * depth, and coverage
        for each third of the runway, in the order from the threshold having the lower runway designation number.
  * A new definition of SNOWTAM, which now also includes hazards due to (standing \> 3 mm) water on the movement areas. This means that it may be necessary to publish a SNOWTAM message not only in the winter season.
  * There will be a new SNOWTAM form and a new SNOWTAM message.
  * Determination of the runway condition by means of the RWYCC, which is derived from the RCAM, including the downgrading and upgrading criteria.
  * The maximum validity of a SNOWTAM was changed to 8 hours. After these 8 hours, a new SNOWTAM shall be issued until a message describing the surface condition as WET or DRY can be issued.

### Description of the procedural steps

a. The aerodrome operator shall assess the runway condition for each third of the runway and create an RCR. This report contains the RWYCC and further information characterising the runway condition (depth, type and coverage of contamination). The RWYCC is derived from the RCAM.

b. The RCR will be transmitted to the relevant local air traffic service (ATS) provider. ATS shall disseminate the information via ATIS, D-ATIS or radiotelephony, as appropriate. SNOWTAM will be disseminated on the basis of this information and in accordance with ICAO regulations.

c. Aircraft operators will use the information received for aircraft performance calculations and to determine the required take-off and landing distances. Whenever the runway condition encountered is not as good as currently reported, the pilot shall inform ATS by transmitting an air-report (AIREP).

d. ATS shall forward AIREPs received to the aerodrome operator who will then reassess the runway condition and initiate a downgrade of the RWYCC, if necessary.

## RUNWAY CONDITION ASSESSMENT MATRIX (RCAM)

| Runway condition code (RWYCC) | Runway surface description | Assessment criteria | Downgrade assessment criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| | | **Aircraft deceleration or directional control observation** | **Special air-report of RWY braking action** |
| **6** | DRY | | |
| **5** | FROST\<br\>WET (The runway surface is covered by any visible dampness or water up to and including 3 mm depth)\<br\>Up to and including 3 mm depth:\<br\>SLUSH\<br\>DRY SNOW\<br\>WET SNOW | Braking deceleration is normal for the wheel braking effort applied and directional control is normal. | GOOD |
| **4** | $-15^{\\circ}C$ and lower outside air temperature:\<br\>COMPACTED SNOW | Braking deceleration or directional control is between Good and Medium. | GOOD to MEDIUM |
| **3** | WET ("slippery wet" runway)\<br\>DRY SNOW or WET SNOW (any depth) ON TOP OF COMPACTED SNOW\<br\>More than 3mm depth:\<br\>DRY SNOW\<br\>WET SNOW\<br\>Higher than $-15^{\\circ}C$ outside air temperature:\<br\>COMPACTED SNOW\<br\>More than 3mm depth of water or slush:\<br\>STANDING WATER\<br\>SLUSH | Braking deceleration is noticeably reduced for the wheel braking effort applied or directional control is noticeably reduced. | MEDIUM |
| **2** | | Braking deceleration or directional control is between Medium and Poor. | MEDIUM to POOR |
| **1** | ICE | Braking deceleration is significantly reduced for the wheel braking effort applied or directional control is significantly reduced. | POOR |
| **0** | WET ICE\<br\>WATER ON TOP OF COMPACTED SNOW\<br\>DRY SNOW or WET SNOW ON TOP OF ICE | Braking deceleration is minimal to non-existent for the wheel braking effort applied or directional control is uncertain. | Less than POOR |

**NOTE:** States that follow EASA Regulations additionally use SPECIALLY PREPARED WINTER RUNWAY for runway condition code 4 and the descriptor WET for runway condition code 3 is replaced by SLIPPERY WET.

## SNOWTAM

### Validity

The maximum validity period of SNOWTAM is reduced from 24 hours to 8 hours. If a SNOWTAM has not been replaced within this period, it will be invalidated automatically.

### Format

SNOWTAM are issued in accordance with the new SNOWTAM format, as shown below. Inclusion of the different Items is either mandatory (M), conditional (C) or optional (O) as indicated. When reporting on more than one runway, the Items B to H are repeated for each runway.

**NOTE:** The letters used to indicate the SNOWTAM Items are only used for reference purposes and will not be included in the SNOWTAM messages.
