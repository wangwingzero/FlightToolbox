# QUALITY AND SAFETY IN ONE CLICK

# Experience the benefits of SMS & QMS, all in one solution.

Developed by IATA for the aviation industry, IMX is a single QMS & SMS platform with an intuitive interface and open database, enabling you to manage, analyze, and share your data. Available in seven languages, the platform provides an user-friendly and cost-effective solution to your risk and audit management.

The IMX helps to establish compliance by using the latest IOSA and ISAGO checklists for self-assessment and to build your safety culture through voluntary reporting and operational risks control.

# Introduction

The IRM contains the abbreviations and terms used in IATA's audit documentation. Terms that do not have a unique meaning in IATA audit programs, or are defined in most dictionaries, are not included in this Glossary. Likewise, commonly used operational terms that would generally be understood by most airline industry personnel are not defined.

Where two or more terms have the same meaning, the definition shown is for the preferred term.

In preparing the document, every effort was made to achieve consistency with definitions of terms used in various industry documents. However, inconsistencies will continue to exist in some of these documents, and users should understand that, where such inconsistencies are noted, common sense will prevail in providing an interpretation.

# Applicability and Purpose

The purpose of the IRM is to provide common definitions of terms, as well as the meaning of definitions and acronyms, contained in or associated with:

- Standards in the IOSA Program Manual (IPM), ISAGO Program Manual (GOPM) & ISSA Program Manual (ISPM);  
- Standards and Recommended Practices in the IOSA Standards Manual (ISM), ISAGO Standards Manual (GOSM) & ISSA Standards Manual (ISSM);  
- Procedures and Guidance in various parts of the IOSA Audit Handbook (IAH) & ISAGO GoGuides:

Thus, the IRM is applicable to the above-mentioned documents.

# Modification Status

All changes in this document are listed in the revision highlights table. For easier orientation, the following symbols identify any changes made within each section:

Addition of a new item.  
$\triangle$  Change to an item.  
$\otimes$  Deletion of an item.

As Class 2 EFBs are capable of reading data from aircraft busses they are typically subject to airworthiness requirements or approvals;  
- A Class 3 EFB is essentially an avionics system subject to airworthiness requirements and approvals. These range from panel mounted Multi-Function Displays (MFDs) to custom integrated airworthy systems.

Taxi Fuel--The fuel required from engine start to the start of takeoff roll.

Trip Fuel – The aggregate fuel required for a planned flight calculated from takeoff or the point of in-flight re-planning until landing at the destination airport. Trip fuel is based on accurate consumption data and takes into consideration an appropriately planned ATC routing (considering weather, NOTAMS, ATS procedures/restictions/delays and MEL/CDL restrictions) at an optimum altitude and speed schedule for the winds, temperatures and mass of the aircraft. Trip fuel does not include Taxi Fuel (in or out), Alternate Fuel, Holding Fuel, Contingency Fuel, Reserve Fuel, Additional Fuel and/or Tanker Fuel.

Takeoff Alternate Fuel- The fuel required for diversion after takeoff to an approach and landing at a designated takeoff alternate whenever the weather conditions at the airport of departure are at or below the applicable airport operating landing minima or other operational conditions exist that would preclude a return to the airport of departure.

En route Alternate Fuel- The fuel required for a diversion to an approach and landing at a designated en route alternate after an aircraft experiences an abnormal or emergency condition while en route.

EDTO (ETOPS) En route Alternate Fuel–The fuel required for a diversion to an approach and landing at a designated ETOPS en route alternate at which an aircraft would be able to land after experiencing an engine shutdown or other abnormal or emergency condition while en route in an EDTO (ETOPS) operation.

Destination Alternate Fuel- The fuel required for a missed approach at the destination and diversion to an approach and landing at a designated alternate airport via an appropriate ATC routing and under conditions of altitude and fuel consumption designated by the Authority.

Holding Fuel – The fuel required for anticipated and/or possible air traffic, weather, low visibility/instrument landing conditions, or other in-flight delays.

Contingency Fuel- The fuel, in addition to trip fuel, required to compensate for unforeseen factors that could have an influence on fuel consumption to the destination airport; such factors include un-forecast en route variations in winds, temperatures, weather, deviation from planned flight routing, cruising levels and extended taxi times.

Reserve Fuel – The required fuel, in addition to trip fuel, not planned for normal use but remaining available for unplanned events in the case where all other useable fuel beyond trip, contingency, holding and alternate fuel has been consumed. This fuel is to be used only when there is no other safer alternative and is often defined by the Authority.

Final Reserve Fuel- The amount of fuel calculated using the estimated aircraft mass on arrival at the destination alternate airport or the destination airport, when no destination alternate airport is required:

- For a reciprocating engine aircraft, the amount of fuel required to fly 45 minutes, under speed and altitude conditions specified by the State of the Operator; or  
- For a turbine engine aircraft, the amount of fuel to fly for 30 minutes at a height of 1500 feet above the airport in standard conditions or under speed and altitude conditions specified by the State.

Additional Fuel-A supplementary amount of fuel required only if the sum of Trip Fuel, Destination Alternate Fuel, Contingency Fuel and Final Reserve Fuel is insufficient to allow an aircraft to comply with the most critical fuel scenario as defined by the State.

Discretionary Fuel--The extra amount of fuel to be carried at the discretion of the pilot-in-command.

Tanker Fuel—The fuel transported for economic reasons or for operator convenience (e.g. due to price/availability at destination).

Unusable Fuel- The fuel transported for operational purposes, such as fuel carried to meet MEL requirements or as ballast for weight and balance purposes.
